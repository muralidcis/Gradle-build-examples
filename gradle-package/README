How to run gradle witout the gradle installation and setup.
Gradle uses wrapper task, basically they are java classes, which download and fetches gradle to the system at run time. 


create a build.gradle and add the task with the following wrapper and the gradle version.

task createWrapper(type: Wrapper) {
     gradleVersion = '2.2.1'
}
  
Run this build to generate gradlew sh and executable classes. 

After running the task this will generate  the following files and this use this configuration in the deploy system to use it without pre installation of gradle scripts. 


|-- build.gradle
|-- gradle
|   `-- wrapper
|       |-- gradle-wrapper.jar
|       `-- gradle-wrapper.properties
|-- gradlew
|-- gradlew.bat


Example:
task sayhello{
println 'hello world!'
}

sudo ./gradlew sayhello, this wil download the gradle 2.2.1 and execute the task.
